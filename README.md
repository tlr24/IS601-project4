For this project, users are able to register, login, and logout. They can also upload a CSV file of transactions like the one given on Canvas to then see their transactions that get stored in the database on the dashboard alongside their balance.

The logs folder is not in the gitignore so you can see the csv.log file for what the entry looks like each time a user upoads a CSV file.

All the tests listed in the project requirements can be found in the tests folder in their respective files.

Admin users can also use the user and transaction management pages.
